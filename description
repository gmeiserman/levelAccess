The position specifically involves testing for accessibility against Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 guidelines. It also requires that the tester is able to provide code level examples for issues found while testing, typically in HTML. What we would like to explore at this time is your ability to code a simple HTML page which includes the following elements:

 

Login (heading)
Username (label) Username textbox
Password(label) Password textbox
Login Button

 

A Word document with the basic user interface is also attached to this email for your reference. While creating this code sample, please feel free to provide any additional code samples with CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, ASP.NET or provide details about your experience with these languages.

 

Though not required, we understand some applicants have limited working experience or do not have a portfolio to share. For the purpose of highlighting front-end development experience, please consider the following optional additions to the exercise. Keep accessibility in mind with regard to all aspects of the sample form.

 

Client-side Validation
Add constraint information for the password field (Ex: Password must include one capital letter, one lower case letter, and at least one number.)
Check for the username “level” and password of “Access123”.
If successful, display an alert informing the user that there was a success. Also feel free to redirect to a page with text that says “You have signed in!”
If unsuccessful, display an error notifying the user that the username/password combination was not recognized.
Style the form
Use custom explicit labels.
Round the form field corners slightly.
Place the form in a styled area of the page.
Style the submit button
Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks with which you have experience. Also feel free to add more complex form fields to highlight more difficult implementations.
